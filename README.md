# v0.9 (./)

Version notes:

- Current network: devnet
- We are in the process of incorporating our Nuxt.js front template into our React.js CRUD app. As per this version both apps are separated.
- To check out the registry, go to localhost:3000/registry.
- In the app, to access the project description page, go to "all projects" then hover over a project and click "see more info".
- If the homepage doesn't load at first, hit refresh.
- In the registry, wallet autoconnect has unpredictible behavior. If you are wondering what the mint buttons do but can't connect your wallet, they currently mint from a common sample candy machine.
