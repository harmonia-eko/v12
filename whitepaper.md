#Proof of Concept

##Observations

We at harmonia-eko noticed a bubbling atmosphere in the climate activism community. Despite a ubiquitous dread, we noticed many promising ideas.

We had that feeling that many projects were missing:

- funds,
- public opinion approval,
- scaling.

However, and especially when combined, it was clear these projects could change the world for the best.

##Legacy Solutions

We observed that there were already some CO2 offset outlets such as from [goldstandard](http://marketplace.goldstandard.org) or [UN](http://offset.climateneutralnow.org) that were typically coopting sellers.

On another hand, there were already existing blockchain attempts on environmental accounting and some existing research, such as the [climate ledger initiative](https://www.climateledger.org/), which we draw conclusions and legitimacy from.

#Our Technology
##Marketplace
So first, we came up with the idea of a marketplace to pit together sellers and let the grand scheme of the free market do its job.

Also, this marketplace has the ambition to massively democratize voluntary offsets to all spheres of society.
Indeed, the aim is to bring cheap and reliable offset to the masses so every person, company or government can offset their lifetime emissions by a couple of times.

However, that was not enough.

We also decided to offer more decentralization and automation to the market of carbon offsets. We thus saw the opportunity behind smart contracts.

##Smart Contract

After some research, it became clear Solana was a good fit for the position, with its growing ecosystem on a very energy efficient network, especially given the flaws of Ethereum.

Indeed, Ethereum had two fatal flaws in our opinion: transactions fees were often unbearably high and the current proof of work algorithm was almost unbearable from a climate point of view.

So our dApp keeps track of sellers' stock and purchased amount. We then serve a public registry with a graphic, real-time and interactive display on our online marketplace.

Also, this will enable next generation stock management for a product that was typically seen as on-demand only.

##Decentralized Certification System

We are doing ongoing research on how to best decentralize the certification system, that is necessary to prevent fraud . Indeed, the products we are selling are subject to double accounting and the actual quality cannot be checked by the customer.

We will most likely develop a network of validators from a wide range of scientist and organizations over the world. They will also be able to rate impacts and safety of the offsets with the high accuracy caused by data aggregation.

##User Experience and Gamification

Buyers will obtain collectable NFTs in exchange for participation in the climate crisis mitigation. That is, certificates will take the form of per project AI-generated NFTs with intrinsic and extrinsic value based on the number of metric tonnes purchased. Shortly, we are planning to introduce new NFT artists to our platform, too.

This will be done thanks to progressive feature levels in the NFT design and a popular algorithm called NFT Candy Machine.

#Our Methodology

###Locality
We aim to empower everyone's local communities, so buyers can sow tangible improvements from their support while no one is being left behind.
###Safety
We aim to promote a wide range of offsets, including mild geo-engineering. We will thrive in doing extensive impact research while mitigating risks through a massive diversity of products.
###Variety
We aim to leverage the magic of the free market to bolster innovation and diversity in our market.
###Decentralization and Automatization
We do not want to be middlemen. We are engineers at the core. We will thrive in making the CO2e offset market run smoothly and efficiently for all.
###User Experience
Rewards are always meant as proof of gratitude and care. Let's leverage that, as the world needs small nudges to move forward in the best direction, especially in a free and decentralized world, where change is often powered by that extra incentive.

###Our Golden Rule

We will try our best to make everyone offset that little extra amount, to participate efficiently in both climate justice and the global net-zero race.

#Future development

##Q4 2021

- ICO,
- official launch to mainnet.

##Q1 2022

- Decentralize our NFT creation process,
- Work on decentralizing the seller verification & certification processes, maybe with the use of Chainlink technology.
